# UndocuMoney Web App

##### This project is licensed under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

Inspired by the wheresgeorge.com site and merged with the #undocumoney campaign idea.

The idea of #undocumoney is to highlight the U.S. economy's dependence on money that undocumented immigrants. Our money flows fluidly throughout economies.

The goal of this website is to show case that by:
1. Showing people how to participate
2. Highlighting stories
3. Allowing people to participate in active data crowdsourcing by registering undocumoney and reporting found bills through the account portal.

## Installation

Considering this is a Meteor project, it is pretty easy to start tweaking the code. But first, you need to have the following installed:

- Node and NPM
- MongoDB
- Meteor

Once you have your machine ready, pull the repository or download. On the terminal move into the project root directory and run

```
meteor
```

That's it! You should now be able to see the site at localhost:3000.
