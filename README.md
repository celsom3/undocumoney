# UndocuMoney Web App 

Inspired by the wheresgeorge.com site and merged with the #undocumoney campain idea.

The idea of #undocumoney is to highlight the U.S. economy's dependence on money that undocumented immigrants. Our money flows fluidly throughout economies.

The goal of this website is to show case that by:
1. Showing people how to participate
2. Highlighting stories
3. Allowing people to participate in active data crowdsourcing by registering undocumoney and reporting found bills through the account portal.

## Installation

Considering this is a Meteor project, it is pretty easy to start tweaking the code. But first, you need to have the following installed:

- Node and NPM
- MongoDB
- Meteor

Once you have your machine ready, pull the repository or download. On the terminal move into the project root directory and run

```
meteor
```

That's it! You should now be able to see the site at localhost:3000.

## Contributing

This repo is no longer used for active development. If you want to fork the most updated repo, contact me at celso@digitalstrategy.tips.

#### Why would I do active development on private repo?

It's mainly political. Considering this is a political project, I don't want too much of the source code out for anyone's perusal.
